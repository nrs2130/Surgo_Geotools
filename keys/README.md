# Authentication keys

You can store any keys here that are needed for API access and so on. Please specify here what the exact format of the key should be and where to get it.

A made-up example: add a key called `maps.json` by requesting programmatic access to the Google Maps API on the Google Cloud Console. The format is:

```
{
	"key": "qwerty567",
	"secret_key": "poiuyt987"
}
```
