# Surgo project template for R

This is the default structure for Surgo projects in R. It follows the [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html) structure.

The philosophy is that anyone at Surgo can come in and quickly understand what is happening in any of our projects - what are the datafiles, what preprocessing happens, what analysis scripts are there.

A second goal is to make some data science best practices as easy as possible. This includes:

1. Having a reproducible pipeline that yields the same results no matter who runs it.
1. Running tests on your code and data
1. Not committing unnecessary files to git

## Using this template for a new project

First, familiarize yourself with [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/index.html).

Then, use the "Use this template" button on the main page of the template repository to start your new project.
